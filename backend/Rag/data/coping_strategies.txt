Coping strategies for urges (student notes)

Urges rise and fall like a wave. If you can delay acting for a short time, the intensity usually drops.
Try a 10 minute delay first. During the delay, do a replacement action that matches your situation.

Quick actions (pick one)
- drink water and change rooms
- 20 pushups or a short walk
- cold water on face for 20 to 30 seconds
- text a friend or write a short journal note
- put your phone in another room and use a timer

Urge surfing
1) rate the urge from 0 to 10
2) notice where you feel it in your body (tight chest, restless hands, fast heart)
3) slow breathing for 60 seconds
4) re-rate the urge. repeat for 5 to 10 minutes

If the urge keeps coming back, reduce access. Make the behavior harder to do and the replacement easier to do.
