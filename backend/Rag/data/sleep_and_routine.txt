Sleep and routine tips (student notes)

Sleep problems make urges harder to manage.
Small routine fixes can reduce cravings:
- same wake time most days
- no phone in bed
- 30 minutes wind-down (shower, music, light stretch)
- plan tomorrow in 3 bullets so your brain stops racing

If boredom is the trigger, schedule something short right after classes.
Example: gym, walk, groceries, or a 20 minute project block.
