Trigger tracking (student notes)

A trigger is anything that increases the chance of acting on an urge.
Common trigger groups:
- time: late night, after school, weekends
- mood: stress, boredom, loneliness, anger
- place: bed, bathroom, desk, couch
- device: phone in bed, private browsing, social media reels
- thoughts: "one time is fine", "i already messed up"

Simple trigger log
- when did it happen
- what was i feeling (1 or 2 words)
- where was i
- what was i doing right before
- what did i do instead (even if it was small)

After 5 to 10 logs you usually see patterns. Then you can plan around them.
Example: if late night is the biggest trigger, move your phone charger outside the bedroom.
