UrgeEase Coaching Notes (CBT-style)

When a user reports urges related to pornography or social media:
1) Validate feelings without judgment.
2) Identify triggers (time, mood, environment).
3) Offer a replacement action that is small and immediate (e.g., walk, cold water, text a friend).
4) Suggest urge surfing: notice the urge like a wave, breathe, wait 10 minutes, re-check intensity.

Avoid diagnosing. Encourage professional support if the user is in crisis.
